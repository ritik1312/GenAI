# GenAI
Generative AI (GenAI) models are advanced ML models designed to create **new content**, such as text, images, audio, video, or code, based on a given input. (wheras non-generative AI models are used for prediction tasks)
These models use **large-scale neural networks**, often trained on massive datasets to produce high quality outputs.

1. Text Generation
2. Code Generation
3. Image Generation
4. Audio Generation
5. Video Generation
6. Multimodal (combines different types of data)

Some Text Generation Models.
1. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Developed by OpenAI. Used for natural language generation, summarization, translation, etc.
2. **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**: Converts every NLP task into a text-to-text format.
3. **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)**: Developed by Meta, designed for research and scaling large language tasks (LLMs).
They can be used for code generation also.

**Roadmap**: 
1. Applied ML 
2. NLP 
3. Deep Learning (ANN, RNN, LSTM, GRU) 
4. Transformer and Hugging Face Transformers
5. LLM and Prompt Engineering
6. LangChain
7. RAG systems
8. Fine Tuning LLMs
9. LangChain Ecosystem (LangSmith, LangGraph)
